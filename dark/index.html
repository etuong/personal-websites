                            started. It enjoys the attention of housing many of the world's tallest buildings including

                            <p>According to Wikipedia, computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with how
                                computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or
                                videos. Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and
                                understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real
                                world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information. It involves the development
                                of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a
                                scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial
                                systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such
                                as video sequences, views from multiple cameras. In my graduate studies at Carnegie
                                Mellon University, I took a course in computer vision, which is my favorite course of
                                all time as well as the most difficult! These are projects I completed that will
                                encapsulate the basic idea of this powerful computer science concept. <i>Please note

                            <h2>Tracking</h2>
                            <p>The first groundbreaking work on template tracking was the Lucas-Kanade tracker. It
                                basically assumes that the template undergoes constant motion in a small region. The
                                Lucas-Kanade Tracker works on two frames at a time, and does not assume any statistical
                                motion model throughout the sequence. The algorithm estimates the deformations between
                                two image frames under the assumption that the intensity of the objects has not changed
                                significantly betweenthe two frames. Starting with a rectangle $R_t$ on frame $I_t$, the
                                Lucas-Kanade Tracker aims to move it by an offset (u; v) to obtain another rectangle
                                $R_{t+1}$ on frame $I_{t+1}$, so that the pixel squared difference in the two rectangles
                                is minimized. According to Wikipedia, $A^TA$ is the structure tensor of the image at all
                                points in the rectangle. It's a gradient matrix that summarizes the principal directions
                                in a specified neighborhood of that point.

                                not be too small due to noise (meaning the eigenvalues should not be too small).

                            $$I_{t+1}=I_t+\sum_{c=1}^k w_cB_c$$ The idea to optimize $w$ is to find the minimum
                            residual of the squared difference in the two rectangles. Suppose the residual is
                            $I_{t+1}(x+u,y+v)-I_t(x,y)$, it guarantees an optimized $w$ from above equation
                            provided that the residual is within an acceptable tolerance.
                            $$I_{t+1}(x+u,y+v)-I_t(x,y)=\sum_{c=1}^k w_cB_c \rightarrow r= \left[

                                "easier" for computers to track these objects? How about reducing the color
                                channels by converting the frames to grayscale? Or use various empirical affine

                            <img alt="" src="coding/computerVision/images/scene.png"
                                style="display:table;margin:0 auto;">
                            <p>The question of interest for this topic is "Given an image, can a computer
                                program determine where it was taken?" I used the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach.
                                The BoW essentially trains the computer to reprense the world with visual words.
                                The idea is to give the computer many(!) data (images) to understand and
                                recognize so that it is "smart" enough to identify the next datum. This is where
                                data science like Machine Learning and Data Mining come to play to supervise the
                                dataset. To help the computer interpret the data, we filter the images and
                                extract their properties. A filter bank is a series of flters that captures
                                different visual properties. The Gaussian blurs are to smooth out the details by
                                reducing noise. For example, convolving with the Laplacian Gaussian kernel
                                allows easier detection of edges. Furthermore, the derivative of the Gaussian on
                                the x-direction detects a change in intensity along that axis, thus vertical
                                edges are more prominent. The same can be said for gradient of the Gaussian in
                                respect to the y-axis which shows details on the horizontal edges. Bag of words
                                is simple and efficient, but it discards information about the spatial structure
                                of the image and this information is often valuable. One way to alleviate this
                                issue is to use spatial pyramid matching. The general idea is to divide the
                                image into a small number of cells, and concatenate the histogram of each of
                                these cells to the histogram of the original image, with a suitable weight. The
                                following outlines the basic idea of the algorithm.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Create a filter bank with different sort of scales, orientations, and
                                    bandwidths to measure the responses of the images.</li>
                                <li>Randomly select a number of pixels to examine and group these pixels'
                                    response in a cluster. From these data we are able to compile a dictionary
                                    of visual words.</li>
                                <li>Run through all images and obtain the visual word with the minimum distance
                                    on each pixel. Extract the frequency histogram where the number of bins is
                                    the number of words. For a more accurate result, use Spatial Pyramid
                                    Matching</li>
                                <li>Find the instance word with the largest similarity and assign its category
                                    to the image.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h2>Keypoints - Detectors, Descriptors and Matching</h2>
                            <p>Interest point detectors find particularly salient points in an image upon which
                                we can extract a feature descriptor. In our case, we will be using BRIEF. Once
                                we have extracted the interest points, we can use descriptors to match them
                                between images to do neat things like panorama stitching or scene
                                reconstruction. Keypoints are found by using the Difference of Gaussian (DoG)
                                detector. This detector finds points that are extrema in both scale and space of
                                a DoG pyramid. The objective of this assignment was to learn a tomato soup can
                                and be able to recognize and match it from various angles. We accomplish this by
                                identifying points of interest and match them with a descriptor. One simple
                                descriptor is BRIEF which uses the Hamming distance to compute the similarity
                                between the potential matches. The belowed image on the left shows the ideals
                                points of critical contrast that I needed to match and my results on the right
                                image.</p>

                                matches. The closest and best result I obtained was the top left. Of course, if
                                the test image compares to itself, the percentage of correct matches would be
                                100%, however I believe once rotated, the derivative of Gaussian is more
                                difficult in terms of computing the gradient at the edges. In other words, the
                                eigenvalues is distorted due to the change of orientation.</p>

                            <h2>Homographies</h2>
                            <p>Robots often deal with planes, whether in the form of walls, ground, or some
                                other at surface. When two cameras observe a plane, there exists a relationship
                                between the images captured. This relationship is defined by a 3x3
                                transformation matrix, called a planar homography. This was definitely one of my
                                more favorite topics to learn in Computer Vision because it is highly practical.
                                Let's suppose a robot is at war, it needs to be able to "stitch" the planar
                                images that it "sees" to interpret it as a warzone and take action. A planar
                                homopgrahy allows us to compute how a planar scene would look from a second
                                camera location give only the first image! Furthermore, we can extrapolate any
                                camera angle from any location without knowing any internal camera parameters.
                                Can you quess what simple use of homography? Panoramas! For this assignment, I
                                was given two images of the Taj Mahal and I had to use homographies to create a
                                panorama image of the same scene.</p>

                            minimize the homogenous linear least squares system we seek $arg \; min ||Ah|| = arg
                            \; min \;h^TA^TAh = \lambda_{min}$ If we decompose A using SVD method, the planar
                            homography is precisely the last column of D corresponding to the smallest
                            eigenvalue. Furthermore, if the eigenvalues are zero, h is exactly determined and
                            fits all the points perfect. If the values are positive, the system is
                            overdetermined and a residual will exist.

                                and the relationship between the twisting moment, or torque, T, and the angle of twist
                                $\theta$, per unit length of the shaft, can be determined as follows, once the potential
                                function u is known. $$T =2G\theta \int_\Omega ud\Omega$$ The shear stresses on the
                                elliptical cross-section are given by the following expressions: $$\sigma_{xz}=2G\theta
                                \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}, \; \sigma_{yz}=-2G\theta \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$$
                                The stress function may be written as
                                $$\phi=B\lbrace(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2-1)\rbrace$$ But since $$\frac{\partial^2
                                \phi}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2}=-2G\theta$$ We get that
                                $$B=-\frac{a^2b^2G\theta}{a^2+b^2}$$ $$ \sigma_{xz}=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial
                                y}=\frac{2By}{b^2}\quad \sigma_{yz}=-\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}=-\frac{2Bx}{a^2}
                                $$ $$ T =2G\theta \int_\Omega ud\Omega=-\pi B ab $$ We can also verfiy that
                                $$\phi=B\lbrace(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2-1)\rbrace=\phi=-\frac{a^2b^2G\theta}{a^2+b^2}\lbrace(\frac{x}{a})^2+(\frac{y}{b})^2-1)\rbrace$$

                            <p>Windows Presentation Foundation (or WPF) is a graphical subsystem by Microsoft for
                                rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications. In my coding career I worked
                                with this technology. This page provides a mini project that has a few comprehensive
                                examples of what WPF is capable of. The last topic of this page talks about
                                Model-View-ViewModel (MMVV), which is a software architectural patttern that decouples
                                the user interface with the business logic. This page is not meant to be a tutorial but
                                simply a refresher to those that have experiences with WPF and MVVM.</p>

                                through a series of examples. The first example is on animation. Here I have two images,
                                one is a normal picture of me and the another one is not so skinny picture of me. These
                                two images are overlapped with each other using the Canvas tag. In WPF, every control
                                can only have one child, thus containers like StackPanel, WrapPanel, and DockPanel are
                                used to lay out the interface, howevever they are "stacked" relative to each other
                                except for the canvas and grid containers. Only Grid and Canvas allow for overlapping.
                                Here we use a trigger with a loaded event to begin an animation that changes the opacity
                                of a target with the name "pic" (which in this case is the not skinny picture) from
                                fully visible to invisible within two seconds. The "RepeatBehavior" is set to forever
                                which means the animation loops infinitely. Furthermore, we have two more routed events
                                for mouse in and out which pauses and resumes the storyboard, respectively.</p>

                                demo, we observe some pretty amazing WPF styling. The first style targets the whole
                                Window. It has a trigger that listens to the binding of the property "IsChecked" of the
                                element by the name of "redColorCheckBox." If this value is true, then it sets the
                                background to red. But what background? The background of the specific type, which in
                                this case is the window. The second block of code is inside the Window.Resources which
                                means any styling or defines in this block is applied to the whole window. The first
                                style in here applies to every button, hence in the video clip on the left you see that
                                the three buttons all look the same (height of 30px, height of 80px, font size of 12px,
                                etc). Furthermore, once again we have a trigger and this one is "IsMouseOver", meaning
                                whenever the mouse is over the control (button), the foreground turns red. Styles in WPF
                                do not have to be defined under Resources, it can be defined straight within the scope
                                of the individual control. If you look at the second textbox, you will see that I am
                                manipulating the "Background" and "IsEnabled" properties. The background is binded to
                                whatever value I type in the textbox. This is done through RelativeSource to myself and
                                taking the text property. Similarly, I have a data trigger that compares to my typed
                                text, if it is equal to the string "disabled" then it will set the "IsEnabled" property
                                to false. As you can see, the possibilities of WPF styling is endless. The complete code
                                snippet is below.</p>

                            <p style="float:left;width:60%;margin-left:20px;margin-top:30px;">Data binding is what makes
                                WPF so powerful. In this demo, we will see how to properly create a data template. The
                                XAML is pretty straight forward, we have a listbox and a button. This button subscribes
                                to a click event which we will discuss later. The listbox contains an ItemsSource that
                                populates the collection as well as an Item Template. The StaticResource of this
                                property points to a data template that "customizes" the appearance on how to display
                                the data, which in this sense I assign it to have a grid inside a border and in this
                                grid we get and set the name and age of a person. Note that the binding of "Name" and
                                "Age" are actually properties of an instance of the datum (from the item source). As for
                                the population of the items and the model itself, I handled them in the code behind. I
                                have a class called Person that has name and age as attributes and publicly expose them
                                so the data template can retrieve them. In the constructor I have a list of people and
                                assign it to the item source of the listbox. Note that we can also use the .NET
                                ObservableCollection which implements the INotifyCollectionChanged that works well with
                                MVVM. When users change the name and age of each item, the properties automatically get
                                updated because of the binding, and when they click on the button, there's a message box
                                that shows the person's information.</p>

                            <p>This is an example of a very basic and classic MVVM pattern. The main idea of MVVM is
                                that the Model should know nothing about the View and vice-versa. The Model is defined
                                as any object that holds information. The View is the front end presentational layer.
                                The "link" between the two is the ViewModel. The ViewModel should only know about the
                                Model and not the View, and the View should only know about the ViewModel and not the
                                Model.</p>
                            <p>This example is very simple, we have a listbox, data grid, and combo box that shares the
                                same items source. There is a button that upon invoke will take a textbox string and
                                adds to the collection. The core of MVVM lies in the implementation of the
                                INotifyPropertyChanged interface. This interface allows any messages to be updated back
                                to the View. Any property in the ViewModel that is bound to the View should implement
                                this.</p>

                            <p>I daresay the ViewModel is the most complex part of the application. Afterall, it handles
                                all the business logic and serves as the mediator between the Model and View. Here, we
                                populate the collection in the constructor and listen to the change in selected person.
                                Because the list box, data grid, and combo box all shared the same ObservableCollection
                                and because we notify the same messages back to the view, all three get updated at the

                            <p><i>The study of Chaos Theory to analyze unprecedented events has been advancing since mid
                                    20th century. Scientists and researchers find many applications from this field such
                                    as weather rediction and explanation of the rise and fall of stocks through the
                                    examination of the Lorenz attractor. This page seeks to have a better understanding
                                    of the chaotic behavior of the deterministic system by solving the system of
                                    ordinary differential equations using two numerical methods (Runge Kutta to the 4th
                                    order and the adaptive Runge Kutta. It is shown that the adaptive method yields
                                    significant better results and the analysis of the Lorenz attractor plays a vital
                                    role in understanding chaos theory. For my numerical method grad course, I designed
                                    a software package to understand the behavior of the Lorenz attractor on different
                                    parameters.</i></p>

                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics that concerns the behavior of dynamical
                                systems with sensitive initial conditions. It is based on the notion that a small
                                difference in initial conditions such as loss of significance and rounding errors can
                                cause diverging outcomes to the system (deterministic or stochastic), thus rendering it
                                predictable in the long term. Chaos, as summarized by Edward Lorenz, is "when the
                                present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately
                                determine the future [1]." Chaos theory deals with nonlinear systems that are impossible
                                to predict or control such as turbulence, weather, brain states, and stock market. One
                                main characteristic of this theory is its unpredictability. Because we can never know if
                                the initial conditions are sufficient enough, the ultimate fate of the system cannot be
                                determined. A slight error in measuring the state of the system can dramatically alter
                                the result, and as such long-range weather prediction is not possible. Chaos exists in
                                many natural phenomena such as weather and one approach to mathematically model its
                                behavior is through the Lorenz attractor. The overall idea of chaos theory can be
                                summarized by Poincar´e in 1903: "<i>A very small cause which escapes our notice
                                    determines a considerable effect that we cannot fail to see...even if the case that
                                    the natural laws had no longer secret for us...we could only know the initial
                                    situation approximately...It may happen that small differences in initial conditions
                                    produce very great ones in the final phenomena.</i>"</p>
                            <h2>Motivation</h2>
                            <p>The motivation in this study is that chaotic systems have been widely adopted in many
                                areas of study such as chemical reaction, weather forecast, electrical circuit,
                                stockmarket, human biology , message encryption, etc. The subsequent paragraphs in this
                                motivation section is devoted to explaining an example of the application of chaotic
                                systems in message encryption. One concept that one needs to grasp in order to
                                understand how chaotic systems work in message encryption is that in the chaotic world
                                it is impossible to build two chaotic systems to produce the same output. However, ”if
                                two identical stable systems are driven by the same chaotic signal,” the outputs are two
                                chaotic signals that are identical to each other. With this concept in mind, the message
                                encryption process can be presented as the following [3].</p>
                            <p>Referring to the figure below, at the sending location chaotic signal x is generated and
                                fed into a stable system F to produce the output as another chaotic signal y. Message
                                encryption occurs when the message is mixed with the chaotic signal y and the result is
                                the message-carrying signal y* that has a chaotic behaviour. Next step is to transmit
                                two signals to the receiving location. One is the original chaotic signal x and the
                                other is the message-carrying chaotic signal y*. At the sending location only chaotic
                                signal x is fed into another stable system F which is identical to the stable system F
                                at the sending location. Therefore, the output will be the chaotic signal y, which is
                                the same output produced by the corresponding stable system F at the sending location.
                                Finally, the original message can be recovered by subtracting chaotic signal y from the
                                message-carrying chaotic signal y* at the receiving location. [3]</p><img alt=""

                            <p>A Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations with chaotic solutions for
                                certain parameter values and initial conditions. When plotted, the system resembles a
                                butterfly, hence chaos theory is often time called the Butterfly Effect. A simple
                                analogy is the following: a flap of a butterfly in Mexico can cause a tornado in Texas.
                                The notion is that a slight change in the current state could potentially cause a
                                drastic change in the long-term effect, thus the validity of the starting points is
                                highly sensitive.</p>\begin{eqnarray} \frac{dx}{dt}&=& \sigma (y-x)\\ \frac{dy}{dt}&=&
                            x(\rho-z)-y\\ \frac{dz}{dt}&=& xy-\beta z \end{eqnarray}
                            <p>In Lorenz system, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the system state, $t$ is time, $\sigma$, $\rho$,
                                and $\beta$ are the system parameters. The constants $\rho$, $\beta$, and $\sigma$
                                determine the behavior of the system. Lorenz defines a deterministic sequence as one in
                                which only one thing can happen next from an existing event. Furthermore, deterministic
                                chaos is something that looks random, but is still deterministic. For the purpose of
                                this page, we will use the canonical parameters $\rho=10$, $\beta=\frac{8}{3}$, and
                                $\sigma=28$.</p>
                            <h2>Mathematics and Procedure</h2>
                            <p>Any $n^{th}$ order linear ordinary differential equation can be expressed in the form of
                                a system of first order linear ODEs. Numerical approximation is applied to ascertain
                                values that may otherwise be impossible to solve through traditional methods. One
                                popular family of numerical methods is the Runge Kutta which carries a better
                                computational accuracy than the other methods [4]. Runge Kutta method consists of a
                                number of numerical methods that can provide different levels of accuracy. Runge Kutta
                                Fourth Order is one of the Runge Kutta methods and was introduced in the class.
                                Therefore, the goal of this study is to introduce a new Runge Kutta method called
                                Adaptive Runge ­Kutta method that is hypothetically capable of providing a better
                                accuracy and efficiency than Runge ­Kutta Fourth Order method. The procedure in this
                                study is to solve the Lorenz attractor by using both Adaptive Runge ­Kutta and RK4
                                methods and compare the results. The motivation for comparing the two methods is that
                                the efficiency gained in adaptive RK can be hundred times or more compared to RK4 [5].

                            <p>As presented in the class, Runge ­Kutta Fourth Order or RK4 is one amongst a family of
                                numerical methods developed by two German Mathematicians C. Runge and M.W. Kutta that
                                are cable of approximating the solutions to ordinary differential equations by
                                discretizing both spatial and temporal domains. Runge ­Kutta methods can also be
                                extended to solve a system of initial value problems (IVPs) ­ which is the case for the
                                Lorenz Attractor. RK4 requires four ­function evaluations as presented in equation 4 to
                                8 and it has an error in the order of $O(h^4)$ [6].</p>$$ dx(t) = f(x,t) \quad x(0)= x_0
                            = a$$ $$k_1 = hf(t_i,x_i)$$ $$k_2 = hf(t_i+\frac{1}{2}h,x_i+\frac{1}{2}k_1)$$ $$k_3 =
                            hf(t_i+\frac{1}{2}h,x_i+\frac{1}{2}k_2)$$ $$k_4 = hf(t_i+h,x_i+k_3)$$ $$x_{i+1} =
                            x_i+\frac{1}{6}(k_1+2k_2+2k_3+k_4)$$ where $h$ is the size step and $t_i=t_0+ih$
                            <h3>Adaptive Runge Kutta</h3>
                            <p>Adaptive Runge ­Kutta method is the extension of RK4 method in that RK4 uses a uniform
                                time step size throughout the entire domain (Figure 2.a) while Adaptive Runge­Kutta
                                method uses non-uniform time step size by employing the step size control method in
                                order to obtain an estimate within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$ and with a minimum
                                computational effort. The purpose of adapting the step size is to use smaller steps with
                                steep slope regions of the solution curve and to use larger steps with shallow slope
                                regions of the solution curve in order to obtain an estimate within $\epsilon$</p>
                            <p>In order to adapt the step size, expected error estimate is needed to compare to the
                                prescribed tolerance, $\epsilon$. If the expected error is smaller or equal to the
                                tolerance, the current step size shall be used for the next step otherwise a new step
                                size is to be computed based on the estimate error. There are two common methods in
                                estimating the expected error. The first method, called step doubling, is to take each
                                step twice using step sizes $h$ as full step and $h/2$ as two small steps. The expected
                                error is calculated as the difference between the two results. The second method is to
                                use higher-­lower order method in which the idea is to calculate the error as the
                                difference between results from two order methods, say 4th and 5th, and adapt a unique
                                step size for the next time step throughout.The adaptive Runge ­Kutta method conducted
                                in this study is the Runge ­Kutta ­Fehlberg method, also known as Embedded Runge ­Kutta
                                Formulas (RK45) [5].</p>
                            <p>Runge ­Kutta ­Fehlberg Method (RK45) was developed by a German mathematician Erwin
                                Fehlberg in 1969 with error in order of $O(h^5)$. RK45 requires six function
                                evaluations. A combination of these functions provides the calculation of the next step
                                based on RK4, $x_{i+1}^{RK4}$, (eq.15) and a different combination of these functions
                                provides the calculation of the next step based on RK5, $x_{i+1}^{RK5}$</p>$$k_1 =
                            hf(t_i,x_i)$$ $$k_2 = hf(t_i+\frac{h}{4},x_i+\frac{k_1}{4})$$ $$k_3 =

                                Points where the derivative is evaluated are shown as filled circles. The open circle
                                represents the same derivatives as the filled circle immediately above it, so the total
                                number of evaluations is 11 per two steps. Comparing the accuracy of the big step with
                                the two small steps gives a criterion for adjusting the stepsize on the next step, or
                                for rejecting the current step as inaccurate [5].</p>
                            <h2>Result and discussion</h2>
                            <p>The solutions to Lorenz Attractor found using both methods are presented in Figure 4.
                                These results are projected onto three principal planes xy, yz and xz for the purpose of
                                comparison. It can be observed that in general the plots of solution after a given time,
                                t, from RK45 are smoother than those from RK4. This indicates that RK45 is capable in
                                providing a more accurate result than RK4.</p><img alt=""

                                clear that RK45 produces smoother plots and one explanation has to do with a larger
                                discretization of the time interval. Whereas RK4 uses a for loop algorithm since the
                                time step is constant for every iteration, RK45 uses a while loop because the algorithm

                            <p>Above is a plot of comparison of computational time between RK4 and RK45 for solving
                                Lorenz Attractor. Initial step size used is h=0.1s. Although, RK45 provides a more
                                accurate estimate of the solution within a prescribed tolerance however it is more
                                computationally expensive. Figure 6 shows the plot of comparison of the computational
                                time between RK4 and RK45 for solving the Lorenz Attractor. Both methods start with the
                                initial time step $h=0.1 seconds$. Horizontal axis is the time upper limit, t, in
                                seconds; while the vertical axis is the runtime in seconds for each time upper limit. In
                                light of the accuracy in data taking, for each time upper limit, the runtime was taken
                                for three test runs and the average of these three runs are used to plot the
                                relationship between time upper limit versus runtime. The graphs obtained from both
                                methods are approximately linear line. By using the linear regression in MALAB, the
                                slope of RK4 and RK45 are 0.00065 and 0.0035, respectively. This indicates that as time
                                progresses the runtime for solving the Lorenz Attractor increases by a factor of 0.00065
                                and 0.0035 for using RK4 and RK45, respectively.</p><img alt=""

                            <p>The time spectrum on Figure 7 suggests that the system is always fluctuating and no
                                equilibrium (dynamic or static) is ever reached. Moreover, for a deterministic system,
                                one would expect Figure 6 to have a constant fluctuation (much like a sine wave or
                                horizontal line), but it is clear that the attractor begins to exhibit a chaotic
                                behavior after $t=13$. This is essentially the main idea of chaos theory - that
                                deterministic system never achieves a steady state and trajectory never coincides with
                                any other (See Figure 6). Using both Runge Kutta methods, one thing is certain, it
                                doesn't matter how close two different initial conditions are, their trajectories will
                                eventually diverge.</p>
                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>The fact that the Lorenz attractor is sensitive to its starting point to a plausible
                                extent suggests that Weather is usually predictable only about a week ahead [11]. Long
                                term prediction cannot be made due to the system’s chaotic behavior after some t time. A
                                future study can be examined in the context of random data versus chaotic data. This
                                page solely seeks a comparison between the two Runge Kutta methods as a numerical
                                approximation to study the theory, but real life application calls for unwanted and
                                corrupting noises. Theoretically, even when the system is deterministic, the real time
                                series will consist of a few stochastic data, therefore one should be careful when
                                defining the error as the difference between the time evolution of the ’test’ state and
                                the time evolution of the nearby state. Finally, it is without a doubt that studying
                                chaos theory will provide mankind better control of the predictibility of standard
                                living, but we are far from comprehending its chaotic behavior. It is difficult to even
                                a simplify a gaseous system in a small domain, let alone simulate the weather by
                                breaking the atmosphere into many millions of interactive systems and predict the
                                weather for next month since we don’t know the initial conditions at time t=0 very
                                accurately.</p>

                        engineer and residing in Los Angeles, CA. Uong graduated from the University of California, San
                        Diego with a degree in Structural Engineering (emphasis on geotechnical design and computational
                        analysis) and Carnegie Mellon in M.S Computational Mechanics. He is the recipient of the
                        American Society of Civil Engineers award and scholar of the Leo Politi Foundation. Currently,
                        he works for Baker International as a software developer for bridge engineering in AASHTO
                        specifications. Uong is perhaps best known for his natural curiosity, willingness and dedication
                        for learning, and pragmatic approach on solving problems.</p><br>
                    <p>When he was in college, Uong had three opportunities to study abroad including an internship in
                        New Zealand. It was through these experiences that he was able to see life in a more optimistic
                        perspective. With his camera, Uong has captured many famous landmarks including some classical
                        and modern Wonders of the World such as the Roman Colosseum and Milford Sound. It is his dream
                        to capture the perfect picture in each continent.</p><br>

                    <p>Born to native parents from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, Uong is the youngest of three siblings.
                        With hardworking parents, the Uong family immigrated to the United States with high hopes for
                        their future. As a young child, Uong had little interest for learning and associated more to
                        music and athletics. Eventually learning the importance of education and with inspiration from
                        his parents, Uong persevered throughout the four years he spent in college majoring in
                        Structural Engineering while getting a minor in Mathematics. Even as a working student, Uong
                        consistently attained high marks in his classes and continued to maintain an active and healthy
                        lifestyle by joining a running club and serving as its vice president.</p><br>
                    <p>At a young age, Uong had a candid characteristic to break things apart and put them back together
                        and this attitude brought out this true passion in Computational Mechanics where he is able to
                        wander endlessly in the world of mathematics and science. The very thing (airplane) that took
                        him to the land of opportunity is a work of technology and innovation, and he is determined to
                        make a difference in the tech industry. Uong envisions computing and analyzing structures of all
                        kind in the nearby future to develop a systematic and economical approach to engineering
                        problems.</p><br>

                    <hr>
                    <p>With a great sense for cultural awareness, Uong has visited many countries throughout his time in
                        college including Rome, New Zealand, and Germany. He frequently traveled across the world as a
                        college student gathering an abundant amount of experience for each of the places he visited.
                        With no hesitation and fear, he stepped onto new territories and allowed his experiences to
                        diversify his view of the world. Uong continues to believe that a worldly experience can lead to
                        success. For Uong, knowledge is power and with power, comes the ability to positively influence
                        people’s lives. Each time he traveld abroad, he obtained a vast knowledge of their culture and
                        gained a better appreciation of his own.</p><br>
                    <h2 id="scrollLife">Personal Life</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Uong is considered a world traveler for having been to over 12+ countries. He loves diversity and
                        believes it to be the key to success and acceptance. In his spare time, Uong likes to play his
                        Rodriguez flamenco guitar, pick up a computer language, or go for a jog. Uong's biggest dream is
                        to be a well-respected and ethical engineer to contribute society's needs. His next big move in
                        life is earning an MBA to advance his career and saving money to travel to the Mediterranean! :)
