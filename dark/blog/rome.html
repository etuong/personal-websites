        When I was a freshman in college, I had an opportunity to study abroad
        in Rome, Italy. Spending five weeks in Rome that summer was one of the
        smartest things I ever did in my young life. I met 15 exceptional and
        friendly students who all had the urge to learn with a keen sense of
        curiosity. The overall program was indeed quite expensive , however, the
        experience and education I got out of it was priceless. I especially
        enjoyed my stay in Rome because of my wonderful classmates, I daresay
        they had a profound impact in my life. Aside from the all the fun
        excursions, I also obtained a great knowledge of structural and
        architectural concepts and analysis. The program was very lucky to have
        Professor Pasquale from UCSD lead it. He really knew his stuff and cared
        for his students’ education.

        Rome is a very hot city, humid as well, but I came to appreciate the hot
        weather; it was what kept me awake most of the time! I really enjoyed
        the night life there. Rome is known as the Eternal City for a reason; it
        never sleeps! My typical weekend was very productive. I would explore
        the city, do some grocery shopping, or try a new gelato flavor! What
        made Rome so special to me was the fact that I got to experience so many
        beautiful and sight-wondering places. It was my first time abroad ever
        since I came to USA (so you could only imagine how touristy I was). I
        bought my running shoes and initially intended to run once in a while so
        I would not get fat. To my surprise I found myself running at least once
        a day! Every day I would wake up at 7 in the morning and purposely got
        myself lost so I could force myself to wander around to find my way
        back. I knew my area within a five mile radius to the back of my head!
        If I go back there, it will seem like I had never left!

        I recall the most memorable event in Rome was when I raced with an
        Italian biker to the Coliseum for about 300 meters. We did not look at
        each other, I saw him riding his bike and approached next to him
        (because I like to follow people). He knew something was up and pedaled
        his bike faster. That was when I figured it was on! I could have sworn
        he was going roughly about 20 mph and I was barely catching up with him.
        I felt magnificent, like a gladiator fighting for his life. It wasn’t
        until we got to the stadium that we looked at each other for the first
        time and acknowledged each other. It was an unforgettable event in my
        life; I did something in Rome that I do best, and I did it with style. I
        won the race by the way. ^_^
