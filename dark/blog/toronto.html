        I landed in Toronto really late on Monday midnight because my flight
        from NYC was delayed for hours so my friends and I couldn't pick up our
        car at the rentals. Instead, we headed straight to our sweet hotel suite
        not too far from the airport. The next day, with our Toyota Yaris, we
        drove to Downtown Toronto to enjoy the hustling and bustling the city
        had to offer. Toronto earned the title of "Ethan's Best Architecture
        City" because of its super modern glass use in office and residential
        buildings. Last year one of my kids told me about Toronto and how
        beautiful its architecture was, but upon seeing it so myself I must
        concur with her. There's a famous market called "St's Lawrence" which
        has all sort of food including Foie Gras (it's illegal to produce this
        in America due to animal ethics concerning force-feeding). My friend
        bought a pound or so for $30! They said it tasted like pate and wanted
        me to try but I was too afraid! The thought of it reminded me of those
        poor ducks. I did, however, try the famous peameal bacon sandwich and it
        was delicious! I learned that Canadian bacon was the same as American
        ham. <img src="../pictures/blog/toronto2.jpg" class="right" alt="" />I
        notice that Canadian are much more laid back than the Americans. I'm
        sure it's better outside of the metropolitan area but even for the folks
        in Downtown they seemed to enjoy life more. I don't know, it's something
        about the way they talk and present themselves with elegance and class.
        Around 5 PM when people got off work, I saw many people with some of the
        biggest smiles on their face. The weather was superb, not too cold nor
        hot. Toronto also has some of the biggest and best malls I've ever been
        to, namely Eaton Mall across Yonge and Dunedas street. The buskers there
        are so different and amazing as well. It's funny, one evening a group of
        Native Indians played beautiful ancient music with flutes in the square
        and people were dancing to it, and there was this transvestite that
        tried to hit on my by grabbing my hands. Boy, I think I ran faster that
        night than I did on my marathon! Oh, a bird also shat on my head that
        day.

        <img src="../pictures/blog/toronto3.jpg" class="left" alt="" />Ok,
        moving on, the next day my friends and I drove to Buffalo before
        stopping at the Niagara Falls to eat some hot wings. We went to two wing
        restaurants simply because Buffalo was the birthplace of this delicacy.
        They were really expensive, but worth the experience. To get the most
        out of the falls we crossed the border to view on the Canadian side. I
        parked on the American side because according to my research it was
        cheaper and the attractions are less crowded. I must say, the media made
        the falls look so grand and tall, but in real life they're actually not
        that impressive! I mean, they're beautiful and all (especially at night
        when the lights illuminate the water), but I thought they'd be a lot
        taller. That day we crossed the borders four times, twice to America and
        twice back to Canada. Getting out of America was easy peasy, but getting
        back in was TOUGH. Damn, those custom officials really gave us a hard
        time. I was pissed in one of the crossings because there was this white
        family of 4 that basically had no trouble, and when I was next they see
        this extraordinary dark looking Asian guy and seemed to be nervous. How
        I saw it, it wasn't even an interview, but more of an interrogation.
        When I return from my oversea trips to LAX, they see my American
        passport, greet me with a warm smile saying "Welcome back" and wish me
        on my merry way. These border officials, on the other hand, gave me
        shit. The Niagara Falls was a day trip as there were a lot to do. We did
        Maid of the Mist which was a 20 minute boat ride to face the wrath of
        the falls. My camera got soaking wet but I was able to capture some nice
        shots with a rainbow. In my opinion, the Canadian side is better than
        the American because you get to see the falls directly across whereas on
        the American side you can only see part of it on the side. The Canadian
        side has a straight walkway with beautiful views but everything on the
        American side is cheaper. The closer you get to the falls, the more it
        seems like it's raining. Did you know that the flow rate of the water is
        980,000 gallons per....second!? I guess this is one reason why the falls
        are experiencing such quick erosion.

        is so lovely, I can totally picture myself living there. I was told
        there was a distinct difference in accent from America to Canada, but I
        couldn't tell. Traffic sucks so badly during rush hours, especially in
        Downtown. I must admit, it's even worse than LA's! There is a waterfront
        that is worth visiting. When I lucked out when I was there because of a
        concert that was playing. I took a ferry to one of the 3 island parks to
        take pictures of the skyline and stayed there for a few hours because
        the sun refused to set until...10 PM! The next day I decided that I ran
        out of things to do so I watched Man of Steel. Haha, being the Asian I
        am, I sneaked a box of to-go pad thai and half a dozen of Cantonese
        bakery into the theater. As the movie reeled in, I open my pad thai to
        eat and boy was the smell strong! I was so embarrassed that I'd bother
        my neighbors so I escape to the very back side to eat. All in all, I
        thought Toronto was very enjoyable and I'm glad I went here.
