            <p>June 2013</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text">In 2013, I knew I had to travel once more before I start my master's program, and the initial
            itinerary was to the Miditerrean, but considering that I was going to pay over 60K for Carnegie Mellon, I
            decided to stay in the states and travel to the east coast. My first stop was to New York City and it was
            mind blowing because there were so many people. I especially loved how the city had so many different
            people. 10 minutes in the airport and I saw a group of Chinese here and another group of Europeans there and
            everybody was speaking all sort of languages. Therefore, in that sense I really enjoyed the diversity, but
            the city was just too "fast" for me. People talk fast, people walk fast, people eat fast, and I'm just a
            mellow guy from SoCal. I remember having constant headaches because my hotel was a block west from Time
            Square and so every time I went out or home I had to face a horde of fast walking tourists, it was literally
            like dodging bullets for me! NYC is so amazing; tall buildings, neon lights, and delicious food are just
            some highlights. It's so crazy that over 9 million people live in the Metropolitan area, and I guess this is
            why their Metro system is so sound and effective. The subway takes you almost everywhere and it's quite
            cheap in my opinion. I paid $30 for a 7-day pass (which I only used half since I was there for only 3 days,
            but I gave it to some Scandinavian guy when I was departing from the airport). I am missing the street food
            (namely the brand carts Halah and Sobretto). <img src="../pictures/blog/usa1.jpg" class="left" alt="" />I
            remember walking a lot and to everywhere I could, and by the end of each day, my feet were fried from the
            heat and pressure. I traveled with a photographer's mindset, and I always strive to get that "postcard"
            photo. One of the things I love to do when I travel is visit a gift shop to get inspirations for my photos.
            I try to imitate the postcard in real life. In NYC, it's hard to pass on the skyline and the Statue of
            Liberty. Unfortunately, the statue was closed for restoration due to Hurricane Sandy, but I did manage to
            hop on a free ferry to Staten Island hoping to capture to some nice shots. However, and to my surprise, the
            sun didn't set until after 9 PM! I departed empty-handed back to Manhanttan out of desperation for food and
            rest. That very same night, I was still determined to take more photos so I went to the Brooklyn bridge and
            on my own ride back to my hotel, there was a signal malfunction with the subway system and I was stationary
            for over 45 minutes!</p>

            When it comes to cheap food you can
            get it on the street if you know where to look, but pretty much everything else in NYC is expensive. My
            hotel was like $175 a night for two beds. Oh, let's not forget Central Park and American Natural Museum.
            Both were super dope. On any given day in my college years I would totally run and explore the city like I
            did in Rome, but unfortunately I couldn't do that for any city that I visited. Central Park would have been
            a nice place to run. The Natural Museum wasn't as great as the one in Vienna (I'm being very biased since
            the Vienna's Natural Museum was the first of its kind that I went to), but it did keep me occupied for
            hours. There was so much to learn, so much to read. I noticed that the
            museum had more attention to the Native Indian tribes, which was good since I wanted to learn more about
            them. </p><br />
        <p><img src="../pictures/blog/usa2.jpg" class="left" alt="" />My next destination was Washington, DC, and I was
            very fortunate to have a dear friend host me for two nights. She and her husband were very welcoming and
            kind. They live about 45 minutes away (in Virginia) but were still willing to pick me up and drop me
            anywhere I wanted. If you are reading this, Renata, thank you so much for giving me an awesome time in DC!
            The district was actually one of my bigger anticipations because I had always wanted to visit the Capitol of
            the country. The National Mall is a super long park with many national treasures including the Declaration
            of Independence. Smithsonian was the best. 19 museums for free including the Natural History and American
            History, what can possibly go wrong here? I went to many museums because DC was really hot and humid when I
            was there. I have to say, I feel that I am more well-rounded for doing this North American trip. I think
            having visited three Natural History museums qualifies me for Jeopardy, wouldn't you say so? There were so
            many fascinating exhibitions in all sort of fields (space, air, art, you name it). Not to my surprise, many
            buildings were off limited including the Capitol. You'd need
            something like a year reservation to visit the White House and the closest you can get to it is a mile away
            with securities and gates everywhere; it's not surprise the White House is the most protected building in
            the world. I got no where near this building and my 18-55 kit lens barely scratched a few pixels. Lincoln
            Memorial was packed and the Reflecting Pool was under construction (so was the Washington Monument). I was
            REALLY surprised that the walk to the Memorial was really dirty! It literally had duck poop along the pool.
            Metro in the city was great and works similar to the BART in San Francisco where you pay as you go. I think
            every American should visit DC at least once.</p><br />
        <p><img src="../pictures/blog/usa4.jpg" class="right" alt="" />Chicago was the last destination on my trip. This
            city is so beautiful, especially the architecture, after all this was where the Modern Architecture movement
            started. It enjoys the attention of housing many of the world's tallest buildings including the Willis Tower
            and Hancock Tower. Everyone here called me "Sir!" The weather was not necessarily hot, but super humid. I
            stayed at the best hostel ever, located in the heart of Dowtown! I slept in many hostels before but this one
            is by far the best. For $35 a night, you get free continental breakfast, Wi-Fi, discounts and unlimited
            resources. My 7 roommates were awesome people as well and I shared many great conversations with them. <img
                src="../pictures/blog/usa5.jpg" class="left" alt="" />Some attractions to see are the Buckingham
            fountain, Wrigley Square, Millenium Park, and Museum campus. The Cloud Gate was the best! Miracle Mile is a
            fancy shopping district with many luxurious stores. The transportation from the airport to Downtown cannot
            be any easier, the Blue line directly takes you there with no transfer. CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) is
            $2.25 per fare with $0.25 for the first transfer and unlimited after. Since I was there for three full days,
            I was actually pretty bored at some times and went to the AMC theaters twice! Deep dish pizza was great but
            can be pretty pricey if you're a tourist. The first restuarant that I was recommended to was like $26 for an
            individual serving, but I left because I didn't know it was going to take at least 45 minutes! After some
            research, I settle for a cheaper one near by hostel, but it was good nevertheless. Chicago has a big and
            important African American history; it is said that nearly fifty percent of the population is Africans. To
            my surprise, there isn't any museum dedicated to the history of gangsters like Al Capone. There were times I
            had nothing to do so I watched movies at the AMC (World War Z is great, by the way, but I have never seen
            zombies run that fast before). Overall, my experience in Chicago has been great and my trip to USA is a
            beautiful, well-spent one. I very content with everything and now I'm just looking forward to move to
            Pittsburgh to start my program! :)</p>
