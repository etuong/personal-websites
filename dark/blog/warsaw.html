        I have to say my experience in Poland was pretty good. I did not
        particularly like the architecture in Poland but any opportunity to
        explore a foreign country is always refreshing. I spent three days in
        Gdansk and 5 days in Warsaw and learned about the start of the Second
        World War and the Warsaw Uprising. Personally, I think if you went to a
        country in Central Europe, you would have had enough of the European
        taste. Poland was to me, very similar to Czech Republic because they
        both speak in the Slavic tongue and you could almost always get the
        European “feel,” it’s not like flying from China to Brazil where the
        culture and environment are different. Nevertheless, Poland had a lot to
        offer, especially its Pierogi and extremely rich history.

        My program has over 140+ students and we split in two groups for the
        excursions. One group went to Munich/Vienna and the other went to Gdansk
        and Warsaw. My train to Gdansk was quite pleasant as I saw beautiful
        landscapes and kept myself occupied with my two friends’ guitars, but
        other people in my trip had a terrible time. The director of my program
        even got pickpocketted. It was the most ironic thing in the trip; he
        told us to keep our wallets in our inside pockets and somehow he was the
        one that got mugged. We stayed in a hotel and that was super amazing.
        The location was far away from the main attractions but none of us
        seemed to mind. Polish people are nice, I bet, but they speak with such
        deep tone that I get intimidated. The first night there was all about
        exploring Old Town and finding a restaurant to eat. I offered to spot my
        director because I thought he didn’t have money to eat dinner but the
        smart man actually had 200 Euro in his backpack (or so he claimed).
        Polish currency is called “Zloty.” Three zlotys are worth a dollar which
        makes Poland one of my cheaper countries to consume.

        <img src="../pictures/blog/poland1.jpg" class="left" alt="" />The next
        day we were on a pirate ship to Gdynia and learned the history of
        Westerplatte, the site that WWII “officially” began with German attack
        on Polish military installations. The Germans opened fire first and
        killed 15 Polish soldiers but the Polish retaliated and killed around a
        hundred Nazis. The following day we went to the Malbork Castle,
        previously known as Marienburg, the biggest castle in the WORLD by area.
        The tour included a visit to the Toilet Tower (the Teutonic knights
        would excrete down a hole to a flowing river surrounding the moat) and
        various sites like the church and dining hall. These 13th century people
        prayed a lot, essentially before they did anything. Gdansk was a great
        sight-seeing; the pirate ship was almost exactly like the Black Pearl
        and the people on deck dressed like Captain Jack. There was one fault
        though, and a big one if I may say, the darn ship was fake! It was
        mechanical and accelerated by means of machines and other engineering
        components. The sail was there for show and did absolutely nothing
        despite the strong wind that day. The ship cheated in every aspects of a
        real pirate ship, it even had a fire extinguisher on board! I wanted to
        bust out a Jack &amp; Rose pose from Titanic on the tip of the ship,
        but, of course, I didn't have a partner to perform this romantic act
        with. As for the Malbork castle, it was in every way that I expected it
        to be. The castle was nearly demolished in the war but kept true to its
        brick architecture when rebuilt. I like to picture a movie or famous
        character to remember the site that I visit, so this one definitely goes
        to Robin Hood. How cool is it to climb up the toilet from the moat and
        steal money from the knights? I may even use the money to help the poor
        pirates to buy a real ship.

        The next day we left Gdansk and headed to Warsaw. The ride there was 7
        hours but seemed like 4 thanks to the guitars again. No one got mugged
        this time, thank God. We stayed in a two star hotel in a sketchy
        neighborhood. Warsaw only has one subway line so getting lost is no
        excuse. It does, however, have many trams that connect to various
        districts in the city. I got a $35 ticket one night for forgetting my
        day pass ticket in my hotel room. I had a different day pass (for the
        next day) that was not validated and the inspector wouldn’t let me stamp
        it even though the machine was right in front of me. In contrast to my
        many mistakes in the past, this was not entirely my fault – it was
        simply a mistake for not confirming the pass. It wasn’t like I didn’t
        buy the ticket and purposely cheated. This is the kind of mistake that
        happens every now and then. Anyways, “experience is not what happens to
        a man, it’s what a man does to what happens to him.” I took it well and
        did not flee the scene (although you should know that I was wearing my
        running shoes that night).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In Warsaw we did a walking tour around the main district. We went to the
        Royal Castle. The entire castle including the façade but except the door
        was destroyed in the war. We also visited the Jewish Ghetto and
        synagogue and explored the two uprisings that resulted in bloodbath. I
        had always known that Hitler was a very bad man and that many innocent
        people were killed in the war, but you really need to see visually the
        destruction and psychological impact the war had on the Jewish. They
        were separated from their friends and families and ostracized to a
        concentration camp where they were treated no less of an animal. I just
        wish that everyone could just hold hands together and live in harmony,
        and I think it’s important that I share this with you because it really
        is a tragedy that this country had to endure such pain. On Friday of
        that week some people went to Auschwitz , which was five hours away from
        Warsaw, to visit the biggest concentration camp in history. I didn’t go
        but I learned that over half a million Jews died there. The remains were
        displayed for show and those that were alive were used for Nazi
        experiments. The majority died in the gas chamber or from starvation.
        Even living was worse than death; they were cramped up in a small room
        without beds. Their daily routine started at 4:30 AM with the wake of
        fire hose. They would work in labor and walk around with Nazi’s
        tormented small shoes. All this discrimination, prejudice, intolerance
        was because they were Jews – an identity connoted by a single monster.

        <img src="../pictures/blog/poland2.jpg" class="right" alt="" />On our
        last night there we had a recital of Friedrich Chopin given by a local
        professor from Julliard. It was like, bombastic. I had the best seat in
        the room and saw all his hand movements, well, almost, the guy was like
        skipping dipping in the water, very smoothly and subtle. That day I got
        lost and stumbled upon the biggest mall in the country (Arkadia). I went
        to a music store and bought myself a Yamaha guitar. Yes, Yamaha, no more
        of those Chinese toys. This is my seventh guitar to my collection and
        it’s nowhere like my Rodriguez guitar (my best and most expensive
        instrument). However, for the price that I paid it was fair. Being the
        Asian that I am, I bargained and low-balled to get a 12% discount, which
        was basically a free bag case. I plan on giving this to my nephews when
        I come back. They’re only two years old so I guess their uncle will just
        have to play with it for a while more, but I will definitely teach them
        everything when the time is right.

        So yeah, that sums up my trip. There are more stories but some are best
        untold (if you know what I mean). Ultimately, my program did quite a
        handful activity but we spent a fifth of our time on the train. I’m
        currently back in Berlin finishing my 28 page research paper and eating
        cold noodles. My time in Europe is almost up and I’m flying back to the
        states on December 10. It is already hard to believe my adventure is
        almost over. I never paid so much for anything in my life before, but
        this program has definitely de-stressed me in many ways and I hope to
        come back stronger and more prepared for other challenges / endeavors in
        my future.

        One more thing, of all my times playing the guitar on the train and
        hotel, I was praised by many students and some even suggested that I’d
        busk on the street. So, today I gathered all the confidence in me,
        picked up my new guitar and caught a subway to the tourist center of
        Berlin. I played for exactly 35 minutes (yes, I timed myself) and made…
        oh….not much…. 23 euro cents! Can you believe that!?! A 20 cent coin and
        three pennies from a man 25 minutes into my performance. I mean, it was
        really funny, and despite my unspeakable earning, I actually had a great
        time. People just walked pass and stared at me and I’d just be doing my
        thang. I played Juan Martin’s Farruca (you should Youtube this if you
        don’t know what it is) and even Justin Bieber’s Baby! If Baby doesn’t
        tickle your twinkle, then I really don’t know what gets the job done
        then. No sweats though, my self-esteem didn’t go down, people were
        probably just in a rush or didn’t have spare changes.
