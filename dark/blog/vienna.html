        <p class="text"><img src="../pictures/blog/vienna1.jpg" class="right" alt="" />My stay at Vienna was “alright.”
            Austria is too similar to Germany, I mean, they mostly speak German here. It rained a lot when I was there
            which was no fun. I suppose Vienna would be wonderful for people that love music and opera. It used to be
            the capital of the Hamsburg empire, and then known for its contribution to classical music. Mozart is a hot
            shot here and Viennese waltz is of course well known. I stayed in a hostel and had a very interesting
            experience. On my first night there, I had a bunk bed on top and the people below me were having sex around
            midnight. I don’t really know how they did it because the small room was occupied by 4 other people
            including myself. At first I thought it was an earthquake, and then I realized it wasn’t. Anyway I quickly
            befriended one of the guys in the hostel named Stefan. Stefan looks exactly like Harry Potter. I mean, if
            they decided to make another Harry Potter movie and Daniel Radcliffe had an accident, Stefan could easily be
            casted. He’s very genuine and kind and taught me a lot. Did you know that college in Austria and Germany is
            free? Well, not free “free” because they still pay tax, but free enough that money isn’t a concern for
            college. All male in Austria have to do a “civil service” around the age of 19 where they serve 6 months in
            a non-combat army and 9 months in red cross. Because the tuition is free, education matters a lot and
            society class is prominent. I asked Stefan if my Austrian girlfriend’s parents would dislike me because I
            didn’t have a college degree, and he replied saying I wouldn’t even have a girlfriend without my degree. In
            Germany, a bachelor degree is useless and almost everyone goes for a master’s, although their system is
            different than ours. I’m not quite sure, but I think 5 years is a master’s. Also, the country has a very
            nice policy regarding to unemployment. If you work for a company for more than 6 months, quit, and can’t
            find another job, the government gives you a fancy stipend (enough for a good living) until you find the
            next job. In other words, you could live happily by freeloading off the country’s aid and bouncing jobs
            around for as many times as you want. </p><br />
        <p><img src="../pictures/blog/vienna2.jpg" class="left" alt="" />In Vienna, I went to a residential house called
            “Hunderwasserhaus” which literally means hundred water house. Hunderwasser is the name of the famous
            architect whose philosophy opposed straight lines and simple color in modern architecture. It sounds weird
            to go to a house in a foreign country but Hunderwasserhaus is actually one of the main attractions in
            Vienna. The city is full of palaces such as Hofburg and Schronbrunn and rich in museum. On my last day it
            rained the entire day. I had a train to catch at 12:09 AM so I checked out my hostel and didn’t have a place
            to stay. That day was bad. I didn’t know where I was going or what I was doing. I really was a lost,
            confused boy, walking around the endless streets without an umbrella. I finally found shelters in two
            museums; a famous art museum and a natural history museum. I think the most unexpected fact in my life is
            that I actually an art guy. I happened to have taken many art classes in college, some for credit some for
            fun. I don’t necessary like art, but I appreciate it. The Leopold museum housed many famous art pieces and
            was I exposed to “sound art” for the first time –that exhibition was a recorded conversation from various
            sex
            calls. The natural history museum of Vienna was so big. It was my first time at any natural history museum
            and I spent almost half a day there. A riddle; what smells with its antenna, tastes with its feet, and
            digest food outside the body? A fly! I took a night train that day to Munich, which was an experience. I had
            always wanted to try that, to sleep on a couch bed on a train. It’s a good lesson; if I want to save money I
            could book a night train, that way I could have both shelter and transportation to my next destination. All
            the waiting never affected me because I had my kindle with me. That thing was such a great investment, a
            true time killer. I finished one whole book by the end of my travel. </p><br />
