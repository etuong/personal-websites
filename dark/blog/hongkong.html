        <img src="../pictures/blog/hk2.jpg" alt="" class="right" />I was very
        lucky to have a friend (Aubree) in the country to help me out. I found
        communication in Hong Kong to be very difficult for me as I only speak a
        little Cantonese. Thankfully, I had my friend to show me around. She
        took me to dim sum, where I learned that you have to wash your utensils
        and cups with the tea provided. My hostel was in Tsim Sha Tsui along
        Nathan Road, a really long street popular for shopping and food. It
        rained a lot on my first three days and there was a typhoon warning, but
        overall the weather was really nice. My stay at the Chungking hostel was
        an experience because I totally got hustled by a bunch of Indians!
        Aubree picked me up at the airport and as soon as we got off the bus (a
        popular bus route known to carry tourists), a swamp of Indians started
        to grab us in all the wrong places and tried to lure us to their
        hostels. I have to admit, though, they make good sales people. I'd
        totally buy it if they weren't too aggresive. I felt sorry for Aubree,
        who had to endure the harrassment for a 100 meter walk. Aside from that,
        my room was infested with cockroaches and toilet paper on the ceiling!
        To be honest, I actually didn't mind, it isn't everyday I get to sleep
        with these insects. That said, I sort of embrace it and gave a few
        nicknames (that says a lot about my friendly nature, right?)

        <img src="../pictures/blog/hk3.jpg" alt="" class="left" />Not everything
        was bad at the hostel. I met a nice girl named Laura there and we became
        instant friends. We went to the Peak and Madame Tussauds museum
        together. That was my first time at any wax museum and I absolutely
        loved it. I was so childish and took pictures of every celebrity I know,
        like my man Obama and grandmaster Bruce Lee. Unfortunately, the weather
        that day was so foggy that I couldn't take any nice picture of the
        popular skyline. I also did not have the courage to go back the next day
        because getting there was not easy. I doubt I can get there myself if it
        wasn't for Laura's Mandarin. Hong Kong is really just one big Chinatown,
        and having grown up in LA Chinatown, I was no stranger to the busy
        streets and crazy shoppers. When Laura and I went out for street food, I
        smelled stinky tofu for the first time. I will never forget that smell
        as it is quite... unforgettable. Oh, this is pretty digusting but I have
        to say it, when I crossed the street in Nathan Road (a famous street
        full of shops, just like Broadway in the states), a dog suddenly stopped
        and pooped right in front of me and I was like "who's going to clean
        this up!?" Yeah, that's it.

        I highly recommend if time permits is Lantau island, which features a
        famous Buddha statue. The drive up there is magnificent enough. You get
        to see the luscious green mountains and cattle on the road. The skyline
        in Hong Kong is the best I've seen so far. At 8 p.m. every day, there is
        a light show where the light synchronizes with music. One day in Hong
        Kong, I spontaneously went to Macau and had tons of fun. There was also
        another day that Aubree took me to the border of Shenzhen. It was
        beautiful, I love the outskirts of Hong Kong.

        Coming here has certainly made me see things in a new way. I am so lucky
        and blessed to be raised in America. There I have good sanitation, an
        opportunity to make a name for myself, and more than anything, freedom.
        Traveling to all these countries is something I will not forget. When I
        come back to the States, I am certain I will have gained a whole new
        perspective on the world.
