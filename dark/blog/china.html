        China was a very interesting experience. I haven't gone abroad in over 6
        years before this! Last time I traveled abroad was in 2011 to Germany
        and it felt like an eternity. China has a very rich history with many
        areas to explore. It's almost the size of United States and 25 days were
        simply not enough time to see it all! I ventured to most of the central
        and western part of the country. This country felt like home to me as
        the culture and people are very similar to Vietnamese. In fact, I grew
        up with predominately Chinese folks, yet it stil amazes me how much more
        I still haven't learned from them.

        <img src="../pictures/blog/china1.PNG" alt="" class="right" />My first
        journey was to Kaifeng where my girlfriend is from. It was a very
        difficult trip as we had to connect to Beijing and take a high speed
        bullet train for 4 hours to Kaifeng's nearest capital, and from there it
        took a few more hours to get to her house. It was all worth the effort
        though. Seeing where my girlfriend lived and her family helped me
        understand how life truly is in China, a country I preconceived as
        developed and prosperous. I was wrong. People in China may have a
        structural integrity in their culture and family upbringing, but
        standard of living is not quite up there yet. I learned that one
        hardship is the long working hours with high expectation. Kaifeng was
        buzzing. Honking cars roam the streets with absolutely no sense of
        yielding. There is a street in Kaifeng that I really liked called
        Bookstore street. The night market on that street is very lively and I
        had my very first scorpion! It tasted crunchy and scary at the same
        time. My girlfriend's families are beyond welcoming and friendly. They
        really showed me the Asian hospitality and maybe a little too much. They
        wouldn't let me pay for anything and took me to the Yellow River which
        is one of the largest rivers in China. It's highly satuated with mud,
        hence the name. I stayed here for 5 days and headed to Xi'an via a hard
        sleeper train overnight.

      <p>
        <img src="../pictures/blog/china2.PNG" alt="" class="left" />The
        difference between a hard and soft sleeper is the quality and setting of
        the beds. Hard sleepers are like dorms on the train with easy open
        access to the hall. Soft sleepers in China are 4 person encapsulated
        cabin with doors and beds are really softer. My girlfriend and I got the
        hard sleeper because soft sleeper usually sells out quickly. It was a
        fantastic experience! I unfortunately had the top bunk so it was a
        nightmare climbing up and down at night with my bladder issues. We got
        to Xi'an the next morning and checked in our hotel. Transportation
        (mostly buses) in Xi'an wasn't so bad and I was introduced to bike
        sharing! It's a concept almost unheard of in America. Popular brands
        include Ofo and MoBike. The way it works is as follows; you download the
        app on your phone, secure a deposit, find any freaking random bike on
        the street, scan the QR code and ride, when you are done close it out on
        your app and pay whatever they charge you. Best part is that you can
        leave the bike anywhere you want! Of course there's social etiquettes
        like don't just throw it in the middle of the street and park them on
        the curb, but unlike the system in USA you don't have to return them to
        the same place you rent them. The Chinese system isn't going to work
        here because America isn't densely populated nor can it handle the
        structure of abandoning bikes anywhere. In Xi'an we went to the
        Terracotta warrior museum and it was amazing! I absolutely love it. It
        exceeded my expectation because I had none. It is so impressive that
        people 2 millenium years ago can build an army of warriors out of clay!
        Xi'an is also known for its muslims and Muslim Quarter is a must visit.
        I must confess, I was disappointed with literally every type of food
        they have there! It is supposed to be the most original and authetic and
        maybe it is, just not for me. I stayed here for 3 days and flew to
        Lhasa, Tibet.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <img src="../pictures/blog/china3.PNG" alt="" class="left" />Lhasa is
        the capital of Tibet. You know the dog breed Lhasa Apso? Yeah they
        originated from here. Let me start out by saying that Tibet is the
        highlight of this trip. I love it so much. The people and scenario, aaah
        so beautiful! My biggest complaint however is the altitude sickness. I
        experienced it so severely that it lasted the whole 7 days when I was
        there. You know the feeling of a hangover after a long night of drinks?
        Yeah it's like that except it doesn't go away!! I was constantly tired,
        dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. I think my altitude sickness at some
        point caused my attitude sickness. To order to enter Tibet you have to
        have a special permit alongside with your Chinese visa. The catch
        though, is that foreigners are forced to get the permit through a travel
        agency. Not by choice I paid near a grand for a 6 day tour that included
        many beautiful monasteries and Mount Everest. In Lhasa we visited many
        temples and saw the yellow-hat sect monks. They are so interesting! One
        thing my girlfriend and I noticed was that most of them had an iPhone!
        Geez, I wish I was a monk. There is so much politics and controversies
        that we can't discuss. It's fascinating that China's "One Belt, One
        Road" policy is so heavily influential in Tibet yet you can almost taste
        the great disdain from the local. Oh, let's not forget about them yaks!
        Yak this yak that yaks are everywhere! A yak is nothing more than a
        hairy cow. In fact, they are so hairy that they will die if they live in
        lower altitude. I mean come on, even our hotel is called Yak hotel! On
        our road trip to Mount Everest, we stopped and saw what I considered
        heaven on Earth. The lushful mountains and everclear skies, words just
        simply cannot describe. I got pretty close up to Tibetan mastiffs too,
        they are so adorable and big. The toilets in Tibet always scared the
        crap out of me. I knew they were bad but boy I was wrong. Some toilets
        are literally a big hole that gets piled up with absolutely no
        sanitation whatsoever. Gosh, imagine falling down in those pits.
        Actually, don't. Is it too late? Are you thinking about it? Okay, moving
        on. Mount Everest! It is so grand and magnificient. Staying overnight in
        a tent at the base camp was some experience. I wish I can say it was the
        best night of my life but heck no. I thought I was going to die there.
        Let's put it this way, I could not breathe! And since it was in the
        middle of nowhere, the toilet hole can only get bigger! I love Tibet, if
        i could go back there I would. After staying here for 7 days I flew to
        Chengdu.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <img src="../pictures/blog/china4.PNG" alt="" class="right" />Chengdu is
        my second favorite. This Chinese city is so pure and calm. It is known
        as the most chilled city in China. In fact, I was told that people in
        Chengdu are so relaxed that in the most recent flood they played Mahjong
        standing over the water! The food in this province is very spicy due to
        the use of chili oil and peppercorn. Not exactly my taste bud because I
        hate the tingling after effect on my tongue, but I do enjoy a new dish
        here and there. It's hard to find any dish in Chengdu that isn't
        swimming in chili oil. One of my favorite activity here was the Giant
        Panda Research Base. It's essentially a zoo only for pandas. The pandas
        are so cute! Lazy but cute! Leshan Giant Buddha is also a great visit
        that is only 2 hours away. Seems like Chengdu loves giant things. After
        checking the buddha out we went to Mount Emei which is one of four
        sacred religious mountains in China. It is so big and wonderful! I love
        hiking in places like this. The city feels very modern like a place
        where I could actually settle in. I was here for 4 days before I flew to
        Beijing.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <img src="../pictures/blog/china5.PNG" alt="" class="left" />Beijing,
        the capital of China, is awesome! I love it here, it had just the
        perfect combination of Western influence and Chinese history. There is
        so much to do here and many food to try. One thing that surprised me was
        that the night markets were all closed down. Apparently the government
        banned night markets due to sanitation and health regulations. But
        nevertheless I tasted many interesting food that I don't how to
        describe. We stayed in the hutongs, which are ancient narrow streets,
        and our AirBnb was very futuristic! Literally everything was electronic
        and I had to carry 4 remotes everywhere I went. The remotes are for the
        window curtains, electric stair, air conditioner, and lights. I even
        used an eletric toilet for the first time and that was really something!
        We went to the Forbidden City and I personally think it was overrated.
        The crowds are insane and it was just really difficult to take any good
        shot. Next time if I come back here I will definitely plan the Forbidden
        City out as a day trip. The subway transportation in Beijing is superb
        and will get you anywhere in the city. My only problem is that you have
        to go through security everytime you enter a subway station.
        Unfortunately I did not get a chance to visit the Summer Palace or
        Temple of Heaven but I did go to the Great Wall. This heritage was a
        beautiful sight, although I still don't believe it served any practical
        purpose back in the days. We went to the Mutianyu section of the wall
        which is a little more isolated but provides better views. I got the
        sense that Chinese people love open spaces and walk around. They love
        going to parks and just chill. On Sept 21 I ended my China trip and flew
        back to Pittsburgh where I continued my job as a software developer.
        Saying bye to my girlfriend at the airport was a pain I wish no one
        would ever have to experience. It was a sensational feeling that tells
        me we would have to be separated for some time and that I was going to
        wake up to reality from this amazing journey of self-discovery and
        cultural apprecation.

        China was an amazing trip. I want to thank you my girlfriend Yvonne for
        showing me around. It's the likes of China and its history/culture that
        strengthen my resolve to travel the world. I can't wait to embark on a
        new adventure soon! Until then, thanks for reading!
