        <p class="text ">Henry Miller once said that “one’s destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing
            things.” I, too, agree with this, in the sense that traveling and being exposed to other cultures opens your
            eyes to a whole new dimension. There is so much that the world has to offer and it's really up to us to make
            the most of it. I was lucky enough to participate in the international research internship program called
            PRIME this summer in New Zealand. Upon receiving notification of my acceptance, I knew that I wanted to
            travel as much as I could after the program. Giving my budget at the time, I was only able to choose four or
            five countries and I chose Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam. In this entry, I want to share with
            you some interesting facts and observations from my journey.</p><br />
        <p><img src="../pictures/blog/sydney1.jpg" alt=" " class="left " />Let me just start out by saying that Sydney
            is the "darling " city of Australia. When you arrive there, you immediately start comparing the city’s
            architecture to cities in the United States. The layout looks similar to a typical American city, but at the
            same time you can't help but notice a change here and there. The way I see it, it's a mixture of European
            and American influences. Aside from the obvious, such as seeing a koala or kangaroo and the Blue Mountain
            range on the horizon, you really need to try the famous market at the heart of Sydney called "Paddy 's
            Market." It's the place for food and entertainment. After a delicious meal, I 'd recommend going to Hyde
            Park a few blocks away where you can just sit next to a fountain and enjoy the breeze. If the breeze isn't
            strong enough for you, then catch a bus to Bondi Beach in Sydney’s suburbs to have some fun in the water
            with the locals. Finally, I want to say that as an engineer, it was definitely a privilege to go face to
            face with the Sydney Opera House! I 've always seen it in photos, but only by getting a close-up look can
            you see it’s majestic!</p><br />
        <p><img src="../pictures/blog/sydney2.jpg" alt="" class="left" />You know Sydney is a tourist city because it is
            bombarded with advertisements, and if that's not obvious enough, you see a group of people with cameras on
            every block! I especially loved how most of the attractions are walking distance from each other and all
            siutated around the downtown district. I went to a kiosk in a mall near my hostel and got a good deal of $50
            AUS for 4 attractions (the tower, aquarium, wildlife, and I don 't remember the last one). The tower was
            amazing! I took so many night pictures up there. This was completely different from the all the other towers
            that I've been to because you don 't climb on it, you take the elevator! I know, right? The wildlife sure
            was wild, check out the picture above! Also, there was a day that I went to the IMAX4 in Darling Harbour,
            the biggest IMAX theater in the world! I saw Toy Story 3 and I had to constantly move my head because the
            screen was too big! On my last day I went to the Blue Mountains which was amazing because I hiked most of
            it, it was an adventurous day for me. I was sick all day and missed the last bus back to town so I ended up
            LITERALLY climbing the mountains and walking back (2 hours) to the town to catch my train back to Sydney. I
            remember that it got dark around 6 PM (summer in the states is winter in Australia) and by the time I got to
            town it was 9 PM! I had wanted to put my thumb up so much but I was scared crapless that someone might kill
            me or eat me or even worse, rape me! See, this is what happens when you watch too many movies. The train
            ride was 2 hours but it only costed $10 AUS!</p><br />
        <p><img src="../pictures/blog/sydney3.jpg" alt="" class="right" />Coming here allowed me to learn a lot about
            myself. I learned that I could be different and acceptable (from the diversity that I witnessed). This was
            also when I finalized my true passion for photography. All the times waiting for transportation, in line,
            for this, for that, etc, I learned to better use my camera. For example, I did long exposure for the first
            time and started to use Adobe Lightroom. Photography is not as easy as most people think; it's not about
            aiming and shooting at something and expect the camera to do everything. I learned to command the buttons
            and features of my Canon and the concept of light.</p><br />
        <p>Sydney is so lovely. I love it very much, especially the diversity. The hostel I stayed at was called "Base"
            and it was recommended by my friend, Negin, in New Zealand. I paid roughly $30 a night (which was the
            cheapest in the city!), but I had to share my dorm with 9 other people. They were very nice but it was so
            hard to sleep because they'd go in and out, and there were days when they had parties too. Sydney is so
            expensive! I ate Subway just about everyday because there was just nothing that I could afford. Even a
            burger at McDonald's was worth $6 USD! Overall, Sydney is a must-see city. It truly is a tourist destination
            and I felt safe all the time. There is so much to do and see. The people are nice and friendly and the
            ladies are very classy. I give this city and country two thumbs up!</p>
