      <p><i>The study of Chaos Theory to analyze unprecedented events has been advancing since mid
          20th century. Scientists and researchers find many applications from this field such
          as weather rediction and explanation of the rise and fall of stocks through the
          examination of the Lorenz attractor. This page seeks to have a better understanding
          of the chaotic behavior of the deterministic system by solving the system of
          ordinary differential equations using two numerical methods (Runge Kutta to the 4th
          order and the adaptive Runge Kutta. It is shown that the adaptive method yields
          significant better results and the analysis of the Lorenz attractor plays a vital
          role in understanding chaos theory. For my numerical method grad course, I designed
          a software package to understand the behavior of the Lorenz attractor on different
          parameters.</i></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics that concerns the behavior of dynamical
        systems with sensitive initial conditions. It is based on the notion that a small
        difference in initial conditions such as loss of significance and rounding errors can
        cause diverging outcomes to the system (deterministic or stochastic), thus rendering it
        predictable in the long term. Chaos, as summarized by Edward Lorenz, is "when the
        present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately
        determine the future [1]." Chaos theory deals with nonlinear systems that are impossible
        to predict or control such as turbulence, weather, brain states, and stock market. One
        main characteristic of this theory is its unpredictability. Because we can never know if
        the initial conditions are sufficient enough, the ultimate fate of the system cannot be
        determined. A slight error in measuring the state of the system can dramatically alter
        the result, and as such long-range weather prediction is not possible. Chaos exists in
        many natural phenomena such as weather and one approach to mathematically model its
        behavior is through the Lorenz attractor. The overall idea of chaos theory can be
        summarized by Poincar´e in 1903: "<i>A very small cause which escapes our notice
          determines a considerable effect that we cannot fail to see...even if the case that
          the natural laws had no longer secret for us...we could only know the initial
          situation approximately...It may happen that small differences in initial conditions
          produce very great ones in the final phenomena.</i>"</p>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>The motivation in this study is that chaotic systems have been widely adopted in many
        areas of study such as chemical reaction, weather forecast, electrical circuit,
        stockmarket, human biology , message encryption, etc. The subsequent paragraphs in this
        motivation section is devoted to explaining an example of the application of chaotic
        systems in message encryption. One concept that one needs to grasp in order to
        understand how chaotic systems work in message encryption is that in the chaotic world
        it is impossible to build two chaotic systems to produce the same output. However, ”if
        two identical stable systems are driven by the same chaotic signal,” the outputs are two
        chaotic signals that are identical to each other. With this concept in mind, the message
        encryption process can be presented as the following [3].</p>
      <p>Referring to the figure below, at the sending location chaotic signal x is generated and
        fed into a stable system F to produce the output as another chaotic signal y. Message
        encryption occurs when the message is mixed with the chaotic signal y and the result is
        the message-carrying signal y* that has a chaotic behaviour. Next step is to transmit
        two signals to the receiving location. One is the original chaotic signal x and the
        other is the message-carrying chaotic signal y*. At the sending location only chaotic
        signal x is fed into another stable system F which is identical to the stable system F
        at the sending location. Therefore, the output will be the chaotic signal y, which is
        the same output produced by the corresponding stable system F at the sending location.
        Finally, the original message can be recovered by subtracting chaotic signal y from the
        message-carrying chaotic signal y* at the receiving location. [3]</p><img alt=""

      <h2>Interested Concentration</h2>
      <p>A Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations with chaotic solutions for
        certain parameter values and initial conditions. When plotted, the system resembles a
        butterfly, hence chaos theory is often time called the Butterfly Effect. A simple
        analogy is the following: a flap of a butterfly in Mexico can cause a tornado in Texas.
        The notion is that a slight change in the current state could potentially cause a
        drastic change in the long-term effect, thus the validity of the starting points is
        highly sensitive.</p>\begin{eqnarray} \frac{dx}{dt}&=& \sigma (y-x)\\ \frac{dy}{dt}&=&
      x(\rho-z)-y\\ \frac{dz}{dt}&=& xy-\beta z \end{eqnarray}
      <p>In Lorenz system, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the system state, $t$ is time, $\sigma$, $\rho$,
        and $\beta$ are the system parameters. The constants $\rho$, $\beta$, and $\sigma$
        determine the behavior of the system. Lorenz defines a deterministic sequence as one in
        which only one thing can happen next from an existing event. Furthermore, deterministic
        chaos is something that looks random, but is still deterministic. For the purpose of
        this page, we will use the canonical parameters $\rho=10$, $\beta=\frac{8}{3}$, and
        $\sigma=28$.</p>
      <h2>Mathematics and Procedure</h2>
      <p>Any $n^{th}$ order linear ordinary differential equation can be expressed in the form of
        a system of first order linear ODEs. Numerical approximation is applied to ascertain
        values that may otherwise be impossible to solve through traditional methods. One
        popular family of numerical methods is the Runge Kutta which carries a better
        computational accuracy than the other methods [4]. Runge Kutta method consists of a
        number of numerical methods that can provide different levels of accuracy. Runge Kutta
        Fourth Order is one of the Runge Kutta methods and was introduced in the class.
        Therefore, the goal of this study is to introduce a new Runge Kutta method called
        Adaptive Runge ­Kutta method that is hypothetically capable of providing a better
        accuracy and efficiency than Runge ­Kutta Fourth Order method. The procedure in this
        study is to solve the Lorenz attractor by using both Adaptive Runge ­Kutta and RK4
        methods and compare the results. The motivation for comparing the two methods is that
        the efficiency gained in adaptive RK can be hundred times or more compared to RK4 [5].

      <h3>Runge Kutta Fourth Order</h3>
      <p>As presented in the class, Runge ­Kutta Fourth Order or RK4 is one amongst a family of
        numerical methods developed by two German Mathematicians C. Runge and M.W. Kutta that
        are cable of approximating the solutions to ordinary differential equations by
        discretizing both spatial and temporal domains. Runge ­Kutta methods can also be
        extended to solve a system of initial value problems (IVPs) ­ which is the case for the
        Lorenz Attractor. RK4 requires four ­function evaluations as presented in equation 4 to
        8 and it has an error in the order of $O(h^4)$ [6].</p>$$ dx(t) = f(x,t) \quad x(0)= x_0
      = a$$ $$k_1 = hf(t_i,x_i)$$ $$k_2 = hf(t_i+\frac{1}{2}h,x_i+\frac{1}{2}k_1)$$ $$k_3 =
      hf(t_i+\frac{1}{2}h,x_i+\frac{1}{2}k_2)$$ $$k_4 = hf(t_i+h,x_i+k_3)$$ $$x_{i+1} =
      x_i+\frac{1}{6}(k_1+2k_2+2k_3+k_4)$$ where $h$ is the size step and $t_i=t_0+ih$
      <h3>Adaptive Runge Kutta</h3>
      <p>Adaptive Runge ­Kutta method is the extension of RK4 method in that RK4 uses a uniform
        time step size throughout the entire domain (Figure 2.a) while Adaptive Runge­Kutta
        method uses non-uniform time step size by employing the step size control method in
        order to obtain an estimate within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$ and with a minimum
        computational effort. The purpose of adapting the step size is to use smaller steps with
        steep slope regions of the solution curve and to use larger steps with shallow slope
        regions of the solution curve in order to obtain an estimate within $\epsilon$</p>
      <p>In order to adapt the step size, expected error estimate is needed to compare to the
        prescribed tolerance, $\epsilon$. If the expected error is smaller or equal to the
        tolerance, the current step size shall be used for the next step otherwise a new step
        size is to be computed based on the estimate error. There are two common methods in
        estimating the expected error. The first method, called step doubling, is to take each
        step twice using step sizes $h$ as full step and $h/2$ as two small steps. The expected
        error is calculated as the difference between the two results. The second method is to
        use higher-­lower order method in which the idea is to calculate the error as the
        difference between results from two order methods, say 4th and 5th, and adapt a unique
        step size for the next time step throughout.The adaptive Runge ­Kutta method conducted
        in this study is the Runge ­Kutta ­Fehlberg method, also known as Embedded Runge ­Kutta
        Formulas (RK45) [5].</p>
      <p>Runge ­Kutta ­Fehlberg Method (RK45) was developed by a German mathematician Erwin
        Fehlberg in 1969 with error in order of $O(h^5)$. RK45 requires six function
        evaluations. A combination of these functions provides the calculation of the next step
        based on RK4, $x_{i+1}^{RK4}$, (eq.15) and a different combination of these functions
        provides the calculation of the next step based on RK5, $x_{i+1}^{RK5}$</p>$$k_1 =
      hf(t_i,x_i)$$ $$k_2 = hf(t_i+\frac{h}{4},x_i+\frac{k_1}{4})$$ $$k_3 =
      hf(t_i+\frac{3}{8}h,x_i+\frac{3}{32}k_1+\frac{9}{32}k_2)$$ $$k_4 =
      hf(t_i+\frac{12}{13}h,x_i+\frac{1932}{2197}k_1-\frac{7200}{2197}k_2+\frac{7296}{2197}k_3)$$
      $$k_5 = hf(t_i+h,x_i+\frac{439}{216}k_1-8k_2+\frac{3680}{513}k_3-\frac{845}{4104}k_4)$$
      $$k_6 =
      hf(t_i+\frac{1}{2}h,x_i-\frac{8}{27}k_1+2k_2-\frac{3544}{2565}k_3+\frac{1859}{4104}k_4-\frac{11}{40}k_5)$$
      $$x_{i+1}^{RK4} =
      x_i+\frac{25}{216}k_1+\frac{1408}{2565}k_3+\frac{2197}{4104}k_4-\frac{1}{5}k_5$$
      $$x_{i+1}^{RK5} =
      x_i+\frac{16}{135}k_1+\frac{6656}{12825}k_3+\frac{28561}{56430}k_4-\frac{9}{50}k_5+\frac{2}{55}k_6$$
      $$R = \frac{1}{h}|x_{x+1}^{RK5}-x_{x+1}^{RK4}|$$ $$\delta =
      0.84\left(\frac{\epsilon}{R}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$
      <p>If $R &lt;=\epsilon$ keep $x$ as the current step solution and move to the next step with
        step size $\delta h$.</p>
      <p>If $R&gt;\epsilon$ recalculate the current step with step size $\delta h$.</p><img alt=""

        Points where the derivative is evaluated are shown as filled circles. The open circle
        represents the same derivatives as the filled circle immediately above it, so the total
        number of evaluations is 11 per two steps. Comparing the accuracy of the big step with
        the two small steps gives a criterion for adjusting the stepsize on the next step, or
        for rejecting the current step as inaccurate [5].</p>
      <h2>Result and discussion</h2>
      <p>The solutions to Lorenz Attractor found using both methods are presented in Figure 4.
        These results are projected onto three principal planes xy, yz and xz for the purpose of
        comparison. It can be observed that in general the plots of solution after a given time,
        t, from RK45 are smoother than those from RK4. This indicates that RK45 is capable in
        providing a more accurate result than RK4.</p><img alt="" src="images/project/RK4_xy28.png" style="float:left;">
      <img alt="" src="images/project/RK4_yz28.png" style="float:left;"> <img alt="" src="images/project/RK4_xz28.png"
        style="float:left;"> <img alt="" src="images/project/RK45_xy28.png" style="float:left;clear:both;"> <img alt=""
        src="images/project/RK45_yz28.png" style="float:left;"> <img alt="" src="images/project/RK45_xz28.png"
        style="float:left;">
      <p style="clear:both;">The top row was plotted using RK4 and the bottom row RK45. It is
        clear that RK45 produces smoother plots and one explanation has to do with a larger
        discretization of the time interval. Whereas RK4 uses a for loop algorithm since the
        time step is constant for every iteration, RK45 uses a while loop because the algorithm
        readjusts the time step to minimize the error difference within a tolerance.</p><img alt=""
        src="images/project/runtime.png">
      <p>Above is a plot of comparison of computational time between RK4 and RK45 for solving
        Lorenz Attractor. Initial step size used is h=0.1s. Although, RK45 provides a more
        accurate estimate of the solution within a prescribed tolerance however it is more
        computationally expensive. Figure 6 shows the plot of comparison of the computational
        time between RK4 and RK45 for solving the Lorenz Attractor. Both methods start with the
        initial time step $h=0.1 seconds$. Horizontal axis is the time upper limit, t, in
        seconds; while the vertical axis is the runtime in seconds for each time upper limit. In
        light of the accuracy in data taking, for each time upper limit, the runtime was taken
        for three test runs and the average of these three runs are used to plot the
        relationship between time upper limit versus runtime. The graphs obtained from both
        methods are approximately linear line. By using the linear regression in MALAB, the
        slope of RK4 and RK45 are 0.00065 and 0.0035, respectively. This indicates that as time
        progresses the runtime for solving the Lorenz Attractor increases by a factor of 0.00065
        and 0.0035 for using RK4 and RK45, respectively.</p><img alt="" src="images/project/Lorenz1.jpg">

      <p>The time spectrum on Figure 7 suggests that the system is always fluctuating and no
        equilibrium (dynamic or static) is ever reached. Moreover, for a deterministic system,
        one would expect Figure 6 to have a constant fluctuation (much like a sine wave or
        horizontal line), but it is clear that the attractor begins to exhibit a chaotic
        behavior after $t=13$. This is essentially the main idea of chaos theory - that
        deterministic system never achieves a steady state and trajectory never coincides with
        any other (See Figure 6). Using both Runge Kutta methods, one thing is certain, it
        doesn't matter how close two different initial conditions are, their trajectories will
        eventually diverge.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The fact that the Lorenz attractor is sensitive to its starting point to a plausible
        extent suggests that Weather is usually predictable only about a week ahead [11]. Long
        term prediction cannot be made due to the system’s chaotic behavior after some t time. A
        future study can be examined in the context of random data versus chaotic data. This
        page solely seeks a comparison between the two Runge Kutta methods as a numerical
        approximation to study the theory, but real life application calls for unwanted and
        corrupting noises. Theoretically, even when the system is deterministic, the real time
        series will consist of a few stochastic data, therefore one should be careful when
        defining the error as the difference between the time evolution of the ’test’ state and
        the time evolution of the nearby state. Finally, it is without a doubt that studying
        chaos theory will provide mankind better control of the predictibility of standard
        living, but we are far from comprehending its chaotic behavior. It is difficult to even
        a simplify a gaseous system in a small domain, let alone simulate the weather by
        breaking the atmosphere into many millions of interactive systems and predict the
        weather for next month since we don’t know the initial conditions at time t=0 very
        accurately.</p>
