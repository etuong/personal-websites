        "I have had the pleasure of working with Ethan at Michael Baker International. Ethan's responsibilities included creating desktop application windows from scratch and conducting code review for his peers.  He would consistently meet the budget of his tasks and never backed down from any unprecedented challenge.  However, what made him stand out in the team was his unsatiable desire to learn and better his skills. His curiosity has helped the team find creative and innovative solutions and his fine attention to small details minimized our reworks.  It is with good faith that I recommend Ethan to any company, I am sure he will prove to be an asset as he had in my team.",
