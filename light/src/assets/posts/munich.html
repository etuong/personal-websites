      <p class="text">The one thing about Europe
        that is very inconvenient is the loo, aka bathroom or washer closet. Public WC costs 50 Euro cent.
        Sometimes I go in a WC not to pee, but to drink water (tap water is clean almost everywhere in Europe).
        Or, I would drink and stay for a while and pee out the water that I drank, you know, to make worth of
        my money. I’m hella cheap in Europe, but there’s one thing that I am not: There are many homeless
        people in Munich, and I tried to help as much as I can. I even gave a homeless man outside my hostel my
        sour candy. Now, I am a sour guy, literally, but the Germans take the flavor to the extreme. Munich was
        a very fun city, and my most anticipated destination because of the Neuswanstein castle (the real
        Disney castle, sleeping beauty tower). </p>

      <p>On my first day here, I went to a bunch of squares and the Deutsches Musuem, which is a museum of
        technology and science, the biggest of its kind in the world. This place surely lives up to its name, I
        was there for over 5 hours and did not finish. Coming here is like any nerd’s dream and made me feel
        really proud to be an engineer. I liked that I was able to apply my basic fundamental to anything that
        was categorized as “science” in the museum like fluid dynamic, Newton’s laws, kinetics, etc. </p>

      <p>For my second day I decided to try the
        world famous beer restaurant Hofbrauhaus. When I was in Prague, I asked my friends at the hostels: “If
        there was one thing about Munich that everyone would know, what would it be” and they told me of this
        place. I bought a liter of dark beer, three breads, and two white sausages and this meal was the most
        expensive meal in my life! I won’t tell you the price because it would just throw you off your chair. I
        knew it was costly and stupid for cheap guy like me, but it was something I had to do – it’s like
        coming to America and not eating a hamburger. Anyways, the beer was so strong. I’m not much of a
        drinker, but I don’t get drunk easily. I forced myself to down the whole thing as a symbol of my
        masculinity. By the time I was done my head was spinning, and it was only 11:00 AM! When I was out in
        the streets, I decided to go to a nearby church that I found the day prior, not for confession, but a
        place to stay until I sober up, unfortunately it was closed so I was forced to wonder the streets with
        dizziness. I wasn’t completely drunk though, I knew that because I passed the test. I was able to count
        backward and walk in straight lines. Well, I misplaced one step, but I blamed that on the wind. </p>

      <p>I went to a palace called Schloss
        Residenz. This was the place Dukes lived in the medieval period and Kings in the classical. It was very
        nice to see how wealthy and prestigious men lived then. I saw their beds, the dining table, the golden
        silverware, the bright ceiling. It gave me a good perspective of what a castle or palace is. This
        palace is so big with over 130+ rooms. If I had something like this, I would cordially invite all the
        homeless people in the world to come live. Each room can host at least 70+ homeless (with extra leg
        space). That’s over 9000 homeless I could help! I noticed that the old people and elders like these
        places – castles, palaces, historical sites. I find that to be very cute. I think babies and old people
        have a lot in common; baby are brought to the world all winkled up, old people leave the world the
        same, babies wear diapers, some old people do the same. </p>

      <p>The next day was so exciting that I could not sleep the night before. I woke up early to catch a train
        two hours away from Munich to a town called Fussen, the nearest town to the castle. I chose this day
        because the weather was forecasted to be “sunny.” When I left Munich it was sunny as ever and I left
        with a great optimism that the prediction would be true of Fussen. Just 15 minutes away from Munich the
        clouds started to come out. I told myself that it would clear by the time I got to Fussen. When I
        actually got there the clouds were more dense than ever and the temperature was less than 36 degree F.
        I was extremely displeased as I had been looking forward to this day for a long time. Then, I thought
        maybe when I climbed up the mountain I would rise above the clouds and the sun would be out. When I got
        to the castle (I had to wait 4 hours for my tour) I asked for the
        weather yesterday and was told sunny. By then I had just wanted to jump down the cliff (that was how
        frustrated I was). So for my time waiting I climbed even higher and said “Open Sesame” as a tribute to
        Alladin, since I was in the real Disneyland, but nothing happened. When I started my tour around 4 PM
        that day, the sun suddenly appear out of nowhere, bright as ever. My heart was filled with joy and I
        immediately forgot the cold. The interior of the castle was really pretty. I even climbed the spiral
        tower that led to the top. I felt like a prince saving sleeping beauty from the fog and depressed
        weather. When the tour ended I ran back to the bridge as fast as I could to take better pictures. It
        was truly a blessing. I couldn’t stop smiling for the next two hours. As a traveler, and more
        importantly, a photographer, I managed to capture the beauty of the castle that satisfied my
        collection. When I was done, I hiked to the Swam Lake, the very lake that inspired Tchaikovsky to
        compose his ballad. Not too many people came here because it was another hour hike from the castle so I
        felt really lucky. It was a beautiful day and I remember how happy I was. I actually liked the turn of
        events; to start with a cloudy day and discover the experience again with the sunny star. </p>

      <p>Overall, my trip was amazing and one that I can never forget. I learned so much in such a short time
        period. This trip made me think of two things. One, I was contemplating whether I should get FB back
        because I had made many good friends, in my program and in my travel like Stefan. Two, I was always
        daydreaming how better it would be if I had “a special friend” to experience all this with. I mean, I
        saved sleeping beauty and all, but I wonder how great it’d be if I could actually hold her hands and
        walk down the narrow streets of Europe or drink a glass of wine with her while crossing Charles Bridge.
        Oh well, maybe she is sleeping under the pyramid of Giza, or Dubai tower, or Manchu Picchu, I’ll find
        her one day. :) </p>

      <p>I think that I am very fortunate to have so many wonderful opportunities and explore this world. My
        roommate in Munich, a kind 30 year old Australian man from Sydney, told me that he never left the
        country until half a year ago. That said, I’m only 22 and have been to over 11 countries by myself! I
        remember coming to America 18 years ago and being fascinated with the flushing toilet, automobile, and
        a little drink called Coca Cola. Now, I have experienced from horse-back riding to ferries, from eating
        Currywrust to Portuguese egg tarts, from jetboating to glacier trekking! :) </p>
