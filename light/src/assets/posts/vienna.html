      <p class="text">My stay at Vienna was
        “alright.” Austria is too similar to Germany, I mean, they mostly speak German here. It rained a lot
        when I was there which was no fun. I suppose Vienna would be wonderful for people that love music and
        opera. It used to be the capital of the Hamsburg empire, and then known for its contribution to
        classical music. Mozart is a hot shot here and Viennese waltz is of course well known. I stayed in a
        hostel and had a very interesting experience. On my first night there, I had a bunk bed on top and the
        people below me were having sex around midnight. I don’t really know how they did it because the small
        room was occupied by 4 other people including myself. At first I thought it was an earthquake, and then
        I realized it wasn’t (don’t ask me how I know). The guy wasn’t good though, I don’t think, because he
        didn’t last long. Whatever. I quickly befriended one of the guys in the hostel named Stefan. Stefan
        looks exactly like Harry Potter. I mean, if they decided to make another Harry Potter movie and Daniel
        Radcliffe had an accident, Stefan could easily be casted. He’s very genuine and kind and taught me a
        lot. Did you know that college in Austria and Germany is free? Well, not free “free” because they still
        pay tax, but free enough that money isn’t a concern for college. All male in Austria have to do a
        “civil service” around the age of 19 where they serve 6 months in a non-combat army and 9 months in red
        cross. Because the tuition is free, education matters a lot and society class is prominent. I asked
        Stefan if my Austrian girlfriend’s parents would dislike me because I didn’t have a college degree, and
        he replied saying I wouldn’t even have a girlfriend without my degree. In Germany, a bachelor degree is
        useless and almost everyone goes for a master’s, although their system is different than ours. I’m not
        quite sure, but I think 5 years is a master’s. Also, the country has a very nice policy regarding to
        unemployment. If you work for a company for more than 6 months, quit, and can’t find another job, the
        government gives you a fancy stipend (enough for a good living) until you find the next job. In other
        words, you could live happily by freeloading off the country’s aid and bouncing jobs around for as many
        times as you want. </p>

      <p>In Vienna, I went to a residential house
        called “Hunderwasserhaus” which literally means hundred water house. Hunderwasser is the name of the
        famous architect whose philosophy opposed straight lines and simple color in modern architecture. It
        sounds weird to go to a house in a foreign country but Hunderwasserhaus is actually one of the main
        attractions in Vienna. The city is full of palaces such as Hofburg and Schronbrunn and rich in museum.
        On my last day it rained the entire day. I had a train to catch at 12:09 AM so I checked out my hostel
        and didn’t have a place to stay. That day was bad. I didn’t know where I was going or what I was doing.
        I really was a lost, confused boy, walking around the endless streets without an umbrella. I finally
        found shelters in two museums; a famous art museum and a natural history museum. I think the most
        unexpected fact in my life is that I actually an art guy. I happened to have taken many art classes in
        college, some for credit some for fun. I don’t necessary like art, but I appreciate it. The Leopold
        museum housed many famous art pieces and was I exposed to “sound art” for the first time – which is
        basically recorded conversation from various sex calls. The natural history museum of Vienna was so
        big. It was my first time at any natural history museum and I spent almost half a day there. A riddle;
        what smells with its antenna, tastes with its feet, and digest food outside the body? A fly! I took a
        night train that day to Munich, which was an experience. I had always wanted to try that, to sleep on a
        couch bed on a train. It’s a good lesson; if I want to save money I could book a night train, that way
        I could have both shelter and transportation to my next destination. All the waiting never affected me
        because I had my kindle with me. That thing was such a great investment, a true time killer. I finished
        one whole book by the end of my travel. </p>
