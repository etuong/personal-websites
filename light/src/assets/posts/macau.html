            <p class="text">Macau...where do I start? Let's see, Macau was actually not on my itinerary. I had no plans
                on visiting here but I am glad I did. Macau is by far the prettiest country in terms of architecture,
                in my opinion. I love the Portuguese influence on these buildings. The streets are narrow and there are
                actually cobblestone! I wish I had taken more architecture classes to describe better, but I don't
                really think words will do. You just have to go and experience yourself.</p>

            <p>Macau is only an hour away from Hong Kong
                via ferry. The ride is really cheap ~$450 HKD which equates to about $30 USD for a round trip. The
                country has its own currency but you can also use Hong Kong dollars. Since it's a major destination for
                tourists as well as gamblers, the natives command a strong fluency in English. I was really surprised
                that I did just about everything in one day (~10 hours). I walked tirelessly everywhere. I wouldn't say
                Macau is walkable but most of the attractions are on the north island. The city is so pretty at night
                with the casinos. The so-called "Vegas of Asia" truly lives up to its name. I wished I was balling to
                play with these people, they all looked so cool! Come to think of, I must have walked over 13 miles
                that day! I had even crossed the Taipa Bridge to a whole different country! Not everything in Macau
                resembles Europe, there are Buddhist temples and egg tarts (Portugese version)! Everyone is so
                friendly. I remember getting lost and asking a woman for directions in Chinese. It was really funny
                because she didn't understand me so we can reverted back to sign language. </p>

            <p>The main attraction (and most famous
                landmark) in Macau, besides all the casinos, is the San Paulo Cathedral (enlisted as part of the UNESCO
                World Heritage Site Historic Centre). In the late 16th century, the cathedral was one of the largest
                Catholic churches in Asia. However, in early 19th century, a fire burned literally the whole church.
                I'm not sure if the fire kindly left the facade or it was rebuilt, but only the main facade remains.
                This place was truly remarkable. Too bad my stupid lens was not wide enough for me to capture its
                essence, this is why I think I should invest in a ultra-wide lens. I highly recommend this country to
                anyone who likes a combination of Europe and Asia with a little Vegas flavor. You will have a great
                time here, I promise! :) </p>
