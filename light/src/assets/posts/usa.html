            <p class="text">In 2013, I knew I had to travel once more before I start my master's program, and the
                initial itinerary was to the Miditerrean, but considering that I was going to pay over 60K for Carnegie
                Mellon, I decided to stay in the states and travel to the east coast. My first stop was to New York
                City and it was mind blowing because there were so many people. I especially loved how the city had so
                many different people. 10 minutes in the airport and I saw a group of Chinese here and another group of
                Europeans there and everybody was speaking all sort of languages. Therefore, in that sense I really
                enjoyed the diversity, but the city was just too "fast" for me. People talk fast, people walk fast,
                people eat fast, and I'm just a mellow guy from SoCal. I remember having constant headaches because my
                hotel was a block west from Time Square and so every time I went out or home I had to face a horde of
                fast walking tourists, it was literally like dodging bullets for me! NYC is so amazing; tall buildings,
                neon lights, and delicious food are just some highlights. It's so crazy that over 9 million people live
                in the Metropolitan area, and I guess this is why their Metro system is so sound and effective. The
                subway takes you almost everywhere and it's quite cheap in my opinion. I paid $30 for a 7-day pass
                (which I only used half since I was there for only 3 days, but I gave it to some Scandinavian guy when
                I was departing from the airport). I am missing the street food (namely the brand carts Halah and
                Sobretto). I remember walking a lot and to
                everywhere I could, and by the end of each day, my feet were fried from the heat and pressure. I
                traveled with a photographer's mindset, and I always strive to get that "postcard" photo. One of the
                things I love to do when I travel is visit a gift shop to get inspirations for my photos. I try to
                imitate the postcard in real life. In NYC, it's hard to pass on the skyline and the Statue of Liberty.
                Unfortunately, the statue was closed for restoration due to Hurricane Sandy, but I did manage to hop on
                a free ferry to Staten Island hoping to capture to some nice shots. However, and to my surprise, the
                sun didn't set until after 9 PM! I departed empty-handed back to Manhanttan out of desperation for food
                and rest. That very same night, I was still determined to take more photos so I went to the Brooklyn
                bridge and on my own ride back to my hotel, there was a signal malfunction with the subway system and I
                was stationary for over 45 minutes! Another thing I love about NYC was the women. O.m.g I never saw so
                many hotties in one place (I guess this was another reason why my head kept spinning). As a tourist, I
                like to visit different museums to be more knowledgeable, but culturally and intellectually. I have
                been to museums of torture, hospital, and space to name a few, but there was none compared to what I
                experienced next - the Museum of Sex! I actually paid $16 for a two-floor exhibition which was
                literally artistic interpretations of porn. I was quite discontent that I had to pay to watch porn. On
                the first floor, there was a dialectical presentation of sexual archievement on gender. For example, it
                was trying to discuss that men and women are the "same" when it comes to maximizing sexual pleasures,
                and so to illustrate this there were two screens (one with a male performer and one with a female)
                performing the same acts (fellatio, anal, etc) to promote awareness that the innate sexuality of every
                being has been existing concurrently with the norms established by societies. There were also works of real sexting between Representative Anthony Weiner
                and his mistress. However, the most interesting work was the "flying cock" of the second floor. The
                entire floor was dedicated to a penis with wings in every context imaginable, and as such I leave this
                topic with your imagination. There you have, I paid $16 to see porn and the flying cock. That day I
                went to the Empire State Building and that was really sweet. When it comes to cheap food you can get it
                on the street if you know where to look, but pretty much everything else in NYC is expensive. My hotel
                was like $175 a night for two beds. Oh, let's not forget Central Park and American Natural Museum. Both
                were super dope. On any given day in my college years I would totally run and explore the city like I
                did in Rome, but unfortunately I couldn't do that for any city that I visited. Central Park would have
                been a nice place to run. The Natural Museum wasn't as great as the one in Vienna (I'm being very
                biased since the Vienna's Natural Museum was the first of its kind that I went to), but it did keep me
                occupied for hours. There was so much to learn, so much to read, and too many ladies to check out. I
                noticed that the museum had more attention to the Native Indian tribes, which was good since I wanted
                to learn more about them. </p>

            <p>My next destination was Washington, DC, and I
                was very fortunate to have a dear friend host me for two nights. She and her husband were very
                welcoming and kind. They live about 45 minutes away (in Virginia) but were still willing to pick me up
                and drop me anywhere I wanted. If you are reading this, Renata, thank you so much for giving me an
                awesome time in DC! The district was actually one of my bigger anticipations because I had always
                wanted to visit the Capitol of the country. The National Mall is a super long park with many national
                treasures including the Declaration of Independence. Smithsonian was the best. 19 museums for free
                including the Natural History and American History, what can possibly go wrong here? I went to many
                museums because DC was really hot and humid when I was there. I have to say, I feel that I am more
                well-rounded for doing this North American trip. I think having visited three Natural History museums
                qualifies me for Jeopardy, wouldn't you say so? There were so many fascinating exhibitions in all sort
                of fields (space, air, art, you name it, not sex though, that's only in NYC). Not to my surprise, many
                buildings were off limited including the Capitol. You'd need something like a year reservation to visit
                the White House and the closest you can get to it is a mile away with securities and gates everywhere;
                it's not surprise the White House is the most protected building in the world. I got no where near this
                building and my 18-55 kit lens barely scratched a few pixels. Lincoln Memorial was packed and the
                Reflecting Pool was under construction (so was the Washington Monument). I was REALLY surprised that
                the walk to the Memorial was really dirty! It literally had duck poop along the pool. Metro in the city
                was great and works similar to the BART in San Francisco where you pay as you go. I think every
                American should visit DC at least once.</p>

            <p>Chicago was the last destination on my trip.
                This city is so beautiful, especially the architecture, after all this was where the Modern
                Architecture movement started. It enjoys the attention of housing many of the world's tallest buildings
                including the Willis Tower and Hancock Tower. Everyone here called me "Sir!" The weather was not
                necessarily hot, but super humid. I stayed at the best hostel ever, located in the heart of Dowtown! I
                slept in many hostels before but this one is by far the best. For $35 a night, you get free continental
                breakfast, Wi-Fi, discounts and unlimited resources. My 7 roommates were awesome people as well and I
                shared many great conversations with them. Some
                attractions to see are the Buckingham fountain, Wrigley Square, Millenium Park, and Museum campus. The
                Cloud Gate was the best! Miracle Mile is a fancy shopping district with many luxurious stores. The
                transportation from the airport to Downtown cannot be any easier, the Blue line directly takes you
                there with no transfer. CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) is $2.25 per fare with $0.25 for the first
                transfer and unlimited after. Since I was there for three full days, I was actually pretty bored at
                some times and went to the AMC theaters twice! Deep dish pizza was great but can be pretty pricey if
                you're a tourist. The first restuarant that I was recommended to was like $26 for an individual
                serving, but I left because I didn't know it was going to take at least 45 minutes! After some
                research, I settle for a cheaper one near by hostel, but it was good nevertheless. Chicago has a big
                and important African American history; it is said that nearly fifty percent of the population is
                Africans. To my surprise, there isn't any museum dedicated to the history of gangsters like Al Capone.
                There were times I had nothing to do so I watched movies at the AMC (World War Z is great, by the way,
                but I have never seen zombies run that fast before). Overall, my experience in Chicago has been great
                and my trip to USA is a beautiful, well-spent one. I very content with everything and now I'm just
                looking forward to move to Pittsburgh to start my program! :)</p>
